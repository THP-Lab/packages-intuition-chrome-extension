          As you approach the entrance to the room, the man gestures towards the
          symbols on its walls, pulsing with a soft, rhythmic light. Certain

          memory, a part of your identity. It&apos;s a sacrifice, but in return,
          you&apos;ll be ready for for what lies beyond.&quot;
