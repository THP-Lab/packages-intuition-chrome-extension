                submitted to the Protocol, whether or not through the Interface.
                Further, the Interface is not the only method that individuals
                or parties may interact with, contribute to, access, or
                otherwise affect the Protocol. Thus, the Services (including the

                viewed as products or offerings provided by the Website. You are

                represents (including without limitation the possibility of your
                crypto-assets being forfeited according to the Protocol&rsquo;s
                rules or being lost for any &nbsp;other reason) before accessing
                it (whether accessed via the Interface or otherwise). YOU

                PROTOCOL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND INTUITION WAIVES ALL LIABILITY

              <span className="c1">
                . Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs
                and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if
                you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you
                under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a
                court proceeding, the Company will pay the amount of any such
                costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary
                to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more
                expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible
                reimbursement as set forth below). <br />
                <br />
                Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable
                law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
                claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought
                for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth
                in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of
                all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. In that case, you
                agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously
                disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under
                the applicable rules. If you prevail in the arbitration and are
                awarded an amount that is less than the last written settlement
                amount offered by the Company before the arbitrator was
                appointed, the Company will pay you the amount it offered in
                settlement. &nbsp;The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
                disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses
                at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either
                party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on
                the merits.
