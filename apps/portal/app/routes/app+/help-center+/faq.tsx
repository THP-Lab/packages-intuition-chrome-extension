        <Text variant={TextVariant.body} className="text-secondary-foreground">
          In the Intuition system, the atomic unit of knowledge is known as an
          ‘Atom’. Every concept - be it a person, an organization, a word, a
          product, or a protocol - is represented by an Atom, serving as a
          conceptual anchor for attaching and correlating data, experiences, and
          perceptions. Atoms are also often referred to as ‘Identities’ because
          they aim to prescribe everything in the world with an associated
          globally persistent digital identifier and relevant associated data,
          allowing us to reference things universally across the web!

        <Text variant={TextVariant.body} className="text-secondary-foreground">
          These Atoms are the basic building blocks of Intuition. Each Atom
          comes with a unique decentralized identifier, structured data that
          describes it, and an associated Vault which enables users to deposit
          and withdraw from the Atom to signal its relevancy.

          In the Portal, when you create an Identity, the data you publish gets
          uploaded to IPFS. The returned IPFS CID is used to create an Atom in
          the Intuition contracts, which accept any arbitrary URI as the
          <code> atomURI</code>. This creates an immutable object that can now
          be referenced universally across the web.

          No, you don&apos;t need to make an initial deposit when creating a an

          Triples let you ‘Claim’ anything about anything! These “Claims” are
          structured like sentences in a format called Semantic Triples, where
          three Atoms/Identities are chained together in a [Subject] [Predicate]
          [Object] structure. For example: [Alice] [is] [trustworthy]. This
          simple approach unlocks powerful utility for users and developers

          Atoms, as this will significantly improve the queryability of the
          data! For example - using an Predicate of [employee of] and Object of
          [Intuition] would allow you to easily surface all employees of
