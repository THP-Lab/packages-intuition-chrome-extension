# Express Your Conviction

## Overview

In Intuition, as in life, the power and meaning of things depend on the strength you give them.

To perform this action in Intuition, you will allocate economic bandwidth to signal what you believe to be relevant and true. Here, you will perform this action by staking ETH on an Atom, by depositing into its respective ERC-4626-esque Vault.

These game-theoretic mechanics help to highlight key information, acting as a tool to separate the signal from the noise through the creation of a Token Curated Registry (TCR) for identities and data.

Because Intuition is entirely permissionless, anyone can create an Atom for any concept. Intuition’s economic incentives encourage convergence, helping to prevent data fragmentation by rewarding users for consistently using consensus Atoms to reference concepts across the web.

## Instructions:

To complete this quest, stake some ETH on an Atom to help curate Intuition’s Token Curated Registry (TCR) of Atoms. The act of 'putting your money where your mouth is' signals the importance and relevance of that Atom, not only to you but also to the rest of the network.

By staking ETH on the Atom, you’ll earn fee revenue whenever any subsequent user interacts with the Atom. The more you stake, the higher your % ownership, and the higher your proportion of fees.
