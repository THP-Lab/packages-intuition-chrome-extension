# Cascading Positions:

When you stake on a Triple, a portion of your deposit is automatically allocated to the Triple’s underlying Atoms, since your interaction with the Triple indicates your belief that these constituent Atoms are relevant to the system.

For example, if you stake on the Claim, `[Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum]`, you will also be staking on the Atoms `[Vitalik], [founderOf], and [Ethereum]`. This process enhances Intuition’s TCR (Token Curated Registry) by indicating which Atoms are most frequently utilized across the Intuition system.
