Still in your trance, the Atom materializes before your eyes. Perfectly circular, perfectly smooth. A tiny fragment of the universe, a package of information, encapsulated in a discrete form.

But it’s blurry. The Atom appears out of focus, as if it has not fully manifested in this dimension… The flames pull you deeper, urging for more.

From the corner of your eye, the flames dance, distracting you. As your attention and gaze shift focus to the flames, their playful movements stop... As if being watched, they become still... calm... predictable…

A stark realization strikes you from deep within - the understanding absolute, almost as if you had always known... You are filled with an understanding that your intention is everything. Your awareness and intention itself are what bring order to the chaos…

You focus the gaze of your mind’s eye on the Atom. As you do, it begins to take form…
