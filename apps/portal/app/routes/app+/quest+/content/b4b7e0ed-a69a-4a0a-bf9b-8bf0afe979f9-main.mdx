# Atomic Knowledge

## Overview

In the Intuition system, the atomic unit of knowledge is known as an ‘Atom’. Every concept - be it a person, an organization, a word, a product, or a protocol - is represented by an Atom, serving as a conceptual anchor for attaching and correlating data, experiences, and perceptions. Atoms are also often referred to as 'Identities' because they aim to prescribe everything in the world with an associated globally persistent digital identifier and relevant associated data, allowing us to reference things universally across the web!

These Atoms are the basic building blocks of Intuition. Each Atom comes with a unique decentralized identifier, structured data that describes it, and an associated Vault which enables users to deposit and withdraw from the Atom to signal its relevancy.

Remember when you onboarded and set up your Intuition ‘Profile’? Behind the scenes, you were actually creating a ‘Profile’ Atom, representative of YOU! In this Chapter, you'll practice creating an additional Atom / Identity for anything you choose, bootstrapping that thing’s identity in the Intuition ecosystem!

## Instructions

To spark your imagination about what to create - think back to when you first started learning about Web3. You probably had questions such as: Who should I follow? Which projects are legitimate? What tools should I use to build my product? These questions arise because the necessary data to navigate Web3 successfully is often unstructured, disorganized, or unavailable.

To make Web3 more accessible and secure, we need to create and curate better, more reliable data. As such, we recommend you start by creating an Atom to represent the identity of anything in Web3. The more data we create, the more navigable our ecosystem becomes.

Choose a project, concept, word, or anything that could be useful for others to understand better, and create an Atom for it. Be detailed—the better the Atom, the more likely it will gain traction, and the more rewards you'll earn!
