A vision? No. You're here. Approaching a tribe, that is welcoming you as family... A seemingly primitive group - more animal than human. And yet... As you approach, their stare tells you otherwise. There is a deep understanding here. They see what you cannot.

The tribe beckons you forward, not with gestures, but with their collective gaze, timeless wisdom hidden behind their serious, knowing, and unmoving faces. You float forward in your dreamlike state, arriving at the center of the tribesmen, where a fire awaits. They reach out their hands as if to say - look.

Your eyes turn from the tribesmen to the fire. As you stare, the flames swirl chaotically… Your vision narrows, entering you into a trance-like state... Warmth embraces you, your vision engulfed in the flames…

This is the beginning. This is the start of something new.

The flames of creation are calling.
