title: 'Chapter 5: Rejection Main'
summary: 'Practice staking on the “negative” / “inverse” of a claim.'

# Overview:

As you’ve now learned, each Triple (again, oftentimes referred to as a ‘Claim’) in Intuition has two Vaults: a 'positive' Vault representing affirmation, and a 'negative' Vault representing rejection.

In this exercise, you will stake on the 'negative' Vault of a Triple/Claim, indicating that you believe the statement described by the Triple/Claim to be false.

For instance, staking on the 'negative' Vault of the Triple/Claim `[Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum]` signifies that you disagree with the statement that Vitalik is the founder of Ethereum.

This mechanism tightly integrates sentiment with the statement, eliminating the need for separate statements to express agreement or disagreement.

# Instructions:

Now, practice by staking against a Triple/Claim!

Please note that it is not possible to stake on both the Positive and Negative Vaults of a Triple simultaneously; you must withdraw your entire position from one Vault before staking on the other.
