As the warmth of the fire embraces you, your senses heighten, and the trance deepens. The rhythmic beating of drums, previously imperceptible, now reverberates through your entire being. The sound is primal, a connection to the very heartbeat of the earth itself. The tribe remains silent, their unwavering gaze never leaving you, their collective presence a guiding force.

The flames begin to morph, shapes and symbols flickering within their depths. You see glimpses of a past long forgotten and a future yet to come. Each image is fleeting, like a whisper on the wind, but they leave an indelible mark on your soul.

The fire's warmth intensifies, wrapping around you like a cocoon. You are neither here nor there, suspended in a state of becoming. The transition is seamless as your consciousness delves deeper into the heart of the fire.

And then, the Atom appears, as if born from the very essence of the flames.
