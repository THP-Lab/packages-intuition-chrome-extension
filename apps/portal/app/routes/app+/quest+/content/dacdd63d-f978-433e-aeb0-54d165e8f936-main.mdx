# A Common Language

## Overview:

With discrete identities for all things in the form of Atoms, we can now compose the represented concepts together into higher-order data structures. This enables more complex forms of expression, much like how words come together to form a language.

To do this, in Intuition, all connections between Atoms are represented in Semantic/RDF Triple format. Triples, also oftentimes referred to as ‘Claims’, consist of three elements: a Subject, Predicate, and Object - very much akin to a sentence in natural language - with each element represented as an Atom.

For example, a triple may be something such as `[Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum]`, wherein `[Vitalik]`, `[founderOf]`, and `[Ethereum]` are all Atoms.

The Subject-Predicate-Object format allows for the clear and explicit definition and interpretation of relationships between Atoms/Identities, making the data highly reconcilable, machine-readable, and usable. These connections can be visualized as a graph, resembling a network with nodes and edges, where each node and edge is an Atom.

Each ‘Claim’ also has an ‘Identity’ - therefore, Triples can also have an associated Atom, allowing them to be used as Atoms in other Triples - enabling the expression of arbitrarily-complex statements.

## Instructions:

In this quest, you are encouraged to create a Triple/Claim to express that some Atom/Identity is Web3-related.

You are welcome to reference anything, but it is advisable to create a statement that you believe may provide value to the collective Web3 consciousness, as useful statements are inherently more likely to gain traction, earn rewards, build your reputation, and help others navigate the crypto ecosystem!
