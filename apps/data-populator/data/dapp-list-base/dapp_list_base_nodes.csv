Covalent's solution will exponentially increase access to and adoption of distributed blockchain technologies for enterprise and consumer use cases.
The first version of Covalent was built in a weekend at a distributed systems hackathon in the fall of 2017. After winning the hackathon, we decided to turn it into a hosted service and start commercialization.
Our team is comprised of industry veterans in database and distributed systems. Covalent is funded by leading venture investors, with over a decade of expertise building and scaling technology companies.
Covalent is solving the data availability gap problem inhibiting the Ethereum blockchain. We provide on-chain data and analytics for blockchains (currently Ethereum), and right now, we're supporting the top DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols in the space -- Maker, Uniswap, Compound, dYdX, to name a few. We support the narrative, ""DeFi is Fintech 2.0,"" and that it will take the intermediaries away. Our goal is to build an indexing engine to search and make it relevant for the end-user.
We're currently building SafeKeeep using Covalent's API -- which solves the DeFi data availability nightmare. SafeKeep goes beyond account balances and positions to a full-blown record-keeping & PnL solution.",https://images.thedapplist.com/dev/uploads/proposals/avatar_covalent.png,https://www.covalenthq.com/
