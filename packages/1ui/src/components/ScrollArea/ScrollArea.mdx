  Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving
  jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in
  the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop
  Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
  jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help but laugh.
  And once they started laughing, they couldn&apos;t stop.
